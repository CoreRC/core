# CoreRC Core

Ongoing project on creating a new robotics middleware :)

# The Core Idea

The core idea of CoreRC is to provide a Rust-centric robotics middleware suitable for high-assurance, real-time systems like autonomous vehicles and industrial robots.

# Project Progression

The project is in its infancy. The first stage is to complete and test the core message broker and the ROS compatibility layer. Second stage is to complete the Unreal-based simulation and visualization environment. Third stage is to improve embedded support, especially for microcontrollers with limited resources.
